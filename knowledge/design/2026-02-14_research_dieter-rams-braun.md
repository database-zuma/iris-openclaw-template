## Key Facts

**Who:**
- Dieter Rams (born 1932, Germany)
- Industrial designer, primarily for Braun (1955-1995)
- Chief Design Officer at Braun
- Now retired, advocate for sustainable design

**Philosophy:**
- **"Weniger, aber besser"** (Less, but better) — core mantra
- Functionalism: form follows function
- Anti-planned obsolescence
- Timeless, long-lasting design over trends

**Braun Era (1955-1995):**
- Iconic products:
  - **SK4 Record Player** (1956) — "Snow White's Coffin", transparent lid, minimalist
  - **606 Universal Shelving System** (1960) — modular, adaptable
  - **ET66 Calculator** (1987) — inspiration for iPhone calculator app
  - T3 Pocket Radio, Sixtant electric shaver, AB 312sl audio system
- Established Braun's identity: clean, functional, no decoration

## 10 Principles of Good Design

1. **Is innovative** — Design should push boundaries, not copy
2. **Makes a product useful** — Function over form
3. **Is aesthetic** — Beauty in simplicity
4. **Makes a product understandable** — Self-explanatory interfaces
5. **Is unobtrusive** — Tools, not statements
6. **Is honest** — Don't manipulate or mislead users
7. **Is long-lasting** — Timeless, not trendy
8. **Is thorough down to the last detail** — Nothing arbitrary
9. **Is environmentally friendly** — Minimize waste, maximize lifespan
10. **Is as little design as possible** — "Less, but better"

## Apple Connection

**Jonathan Ive's Influence:**
- Ive (Apple's Chief Design Officer, 1992-2019) heavily influenced by Rams
- iPhone, iPod, iMac design language mirrors Braun products
- Side-by-side comparisons:
  - Braun T3 Radio (1958) ↔ iPod (2001)
  - Braun ET66 Calculator (1987) ↔ iPhone Calculator app
  - Braun SK4 Turntable ↔ Early Mac Pro design

**Philosophy alignment:**
- Minimalism: Remove everything unnecessary
- User-centric: Intuitive interfaces, no manual needed
- Material honesty: Aluminum, glass, simple colors
- Long-lasting: Build quality over disposability

**Steve Jobs quote (paraphrased):**
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" — echoes Rams's "Less, but better"

## Takeaways for Zuma/Product Design
